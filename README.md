# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Case-Prediction
Project Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 case trends across multiple countries using Python, focusing on data-driven insights, visualization, and predictive modeling. The dataset includes total cases, testing rates, and country-wise statistics.

Tools & Techniques Used
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
Techniques: Time Series Analysis, Data Cleaning, Statistical Analysis, Linear Regression

Objectives
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand COVID-19 trends.Visualize case growth using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better insights.
Compare COVID-19 cases across countries such as India, China, Japan, Germany, and Spain.
Build a predictive model using Linear Regression to forecast future cases.
Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) for accuracy.

Results & Insights
Identified trends in COVID-19 spread across different countries through interactive plots.
Created bar plots and line charts to compare total cases and testing rates.
Built a predictive model to estimate future COVID-19 cases based on historical data.
Evaluated model performance using train-test split (70-30) and MSE calculations
